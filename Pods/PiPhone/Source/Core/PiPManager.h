 @discussion Default `AVPictureInPictureController` behavior is to find the topmost `UINavigationController`'s bar, `UITabBarController`'s bar, `safeAreaInsets`, etc and determine where to place overlay video based on this metrics. Since imitation of this behavior turned out to be complicated and tricky process, it've been decided to control overlay video position based on predefined configurations. For example, choosing `PiPManagerContentInsetAdjustmentNavigationBar` will automatically add 44dp inset from top safe area in portrait orientation regardless of whether there is currently visible `UINavigationBar` or no.
